=============

Running Takipi inside Docker container

----------
Due to https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/2606 we now recommend you use the heroku Dockerfiles as the heroku add-on of Takipi uses less memory (on the expense of error analysis time).

----------
Added CentOS/Ubuntu flavors.
Supervisord is considered deprecated in favor of the new plain && approach.

Building the image:
docker build -t TAG .

Running the image:
